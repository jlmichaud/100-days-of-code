### Day 13: January 17, 2021

**Today's Progress:** I got the binary to decimal converter working in the browser! I tried to get the CSS working better but it's becoming clear that my CSS knowledge is severely lacking.

**Thoughts:** It felt so great to get the project working! I'd really like to get better at CSS.


### Day 12: January 15, 2021 

**Today's Progress:** Started working on making the binary to decimal converter work in the brower.

**Thoughts:** Not a terribly productive day. I quickly realized that I'd forgotten a lot about creating/adding/removing new elements with JS. Needing to re-watch a lot of videos to refresh my memory. Code is getting pretty long and messy and I don't feel that I have a good sense about how to re-factor things but I suppose this will improve with time and practice.


### Day 11: January 14, 2021 

**Today's Progress:** Did a few more lessons in the regex section (to lesson #31). Finally worked out the logic for the binary to decimal calculator!

**Thoughts:** I don't yet fully understand regex but I also like it. It seems very powerful. 

Figuring out the logic for the calculator felt so great... like I'd performed a magic trick! I used an html text input instead of number input in order to be able to loop through the digits and transform them with a Math.pow() using the index of the flipped number as the exponent. 


### Day 10: January 13, 2021 

**Today's Progress:** Completed up to lesson #28 in the regex section of freeCodeCamp's JS certification which came in very handy for my binary to decimal calculator (though I'm still not finished that). Did a bit of work on a meeting time decider app with Gabrielle. We are each working on our own respective JavaScript and Python versions.

**Thoughts:** So glad to finally know about regex! I've seen regex code from time to time in Stack Overflow posts and it's always been something that looked completely indecipherable so I'm glad that I'm finally learning what it is. Seems very useful!


### Day 9: January 12 

**Today's Progress:** Continued working on the binary to decimal calculator.

**Thoughts:** I got very frustrated and eventually (after exercising) realized that I was over-complicating it. I'll give it another try tomorrow and if I can't work it out I'll go back to doing projects that have solution videos that I can refer to when I get stuck.


### Day 8: January 11, 2021 

**Today's Progress:** Started working on a binary to decimal calculator (as suggested in Florin Pop's GitHub list of projects to build).

**Thoughts:** Didn't get as far as I would have liked because I had to spend a bit of time learning about binary (went back to CS50 course for this). Also got a bit sidetracked trying to do some basic CSS styling which was obviously not necessary but I like for things to look pretty. Realized I've forgotten so much CSS!


### Day 7: January 10, 2021 

**Today's Progress:** Completed to the end of section on ES6 in freeCodeCamp's JavaScript certification.

**Thoughts:** The first time I started learning about classes and Promises (in Colt Steele's course) I was rushing through the content, and as a result felt increasingly lost as I kept trying to plough through the lessons, so it was really good to review those topics today. Tomorrow I'm going to start working on a project. No excuses!!! 


### Day 6: January 9, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Worked through 1st Array Cardio Day of #JavaScript30. 

**Thoughts:** Was mostly able to write the code for the problem sets before watching the solutions (although Wes Bos' solutions were more elegant of course). I can see that array methods are gonna be really useful!


### Day 5: January 8, 2021 

**Today's Progress:** Finished up to lesson #19 in ES6 section of freeCodeCamp JavaScript certification. Mostly destructuring from objects and arrays.  

**Thoughts:** I'm feeling a bit bored. I know I need to work on small projects (not just problem sets on freeCodeCamp) in order to make things more interesting and keep myself motivated. I did follow along with the 3rd project in Wes Bos' #JavaScript30 series but didn't feel like I would have been able to code it myself, so definitely not counting that as part of my 1-hour of coding today. I think tomorrow I will try to code the project before watching the solution. I know it will give me a more solid understanding of how to make code do what I need it to do even if the code I come up with is a bit of a mess.


### Day 4: January 7, 2021 

**Today's Progress:** Completed JavaScript Basics section in freeCodeCamp course + up to lesson #4 in the section on ES6.

**Thoughts:** Still struggling to understand recursive functions but I think it's slowly starting to sink in.

 
### Day 3: January 6, 2021 

**Today's Progress:** Completed up to lesson #109 in freeCodeCamp's JS certification. Spent a good chunk of time on recursive functions. 

**Thoughts:** Realizing how often my code isn't working because I forget to *return* the result of a function! Also, the occasional comparison operator typo.


### Day 2: January 5, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Completed up to lesson #100 in freeCodeCamp's JS certification. Reviewed short-circuit conditionals. Started on recursive functions.

**Thoughts:** Short-circuit conditionals seem very useful, if not very intuitive. Ditto for recursive functions. Will need to make sure I take some time with both of these in order to really understand them.


### Day 1: January 4, 2021 

**Today's Progress:** Completed up to lesson #93 in freeCodeCamp's JS certification. Accessing and changing values in nested objects.  

**Thoughts:** I thought I already had a decent handle on those concepts but it turns out I didn't!... or maybe I had at one time and then forgot. Really reinforced the importance of using what I learn every day.


### Day 0: January 3, 2021 

**Today's Progress:** Completed up to lesson #80 in the Basic JavaScript section of freeCodeCamp's JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification.

**Thoughts:** I was feeling really tired today so it was good to just work on reviewing some of the foundational concepts. Why have I never tried freeCodeCamp before?? It's a great resource! Feeling excited / apprehensive about starting the #100DaysOfCode challenge. Hoping that the rules and public commitment will help me build better learning habits!
