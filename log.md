### Day 4: January 7, 2021 

**Today's Progress:** Completed JavaScript Basics section in freeCodeCamp course + up to lesson #4 in the section on ES6.

**Thoughts:** Still struggling to understand recursive functions but I think it's slowly starting to sink in.

 
### Day 3: January 6, 2021 

**Today's Progress:** Completed up to lesson #109 in freeCodeCamp's JS certification. Spent a good chunk of time on recursive functions. 

**Thoughts:** Realizing how often my code isn't working because I forget to *return* the result of a function! Also, the occasional comparison operator typo.


### Day 2: January 5, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Completed up to lesson #100 in freeCodeCamp's JS certification. Reviewed short-circuit conditionals. Started on recursive functions.

**Thoughts:** Short-circuit conditionals seem very useful, if not very intuitive. Ditto for recursive functions. Will need to make sure I take some time with both of these in order to really understand them.


### Day 1: January 4, 2021 

**Today's Progress:** Completed up to lesson #93 in freeCodeCamp's JS certification. Accessing and changing values in nested objects.  

**Thoughts:** I thought I already had a decent handle on those concepts but it turns out I didn't!... or maybe I had at one time and then forgot. Really reinforced the importance of using what I learn every day.


### Day 0: January 3, 2021 

**Today's Progress:** Completed up to lesson #80 in the Basic JavaScript section of freeCodeCamp's JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification.

**Thoughts:** I was feeling really tired today so it was good to just work on reviewing some of the foundational concepts. Why have I never tried freeCodeCamp before?? It's a great resource! Feeling excited / apprehensive about starting the #100DaysOfCode challenge. Hoping that the rules and public commitment will help me build better learning habits!
