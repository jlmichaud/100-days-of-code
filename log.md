### Day 18: January 28, 2021 

**Today's Progress:** Finished the section on basic algorithm scripting in freeCodeCamp's JavaScript certification! Woohooooooo!!!!!!

**Thoughts:** Oof. This section was so challenging. BUT... I enjoyed it! I feel like I'm slowly starting to understand how to approach solving problems:

* break it down into the smallest parts and run each section as I write it to make sure I'm on track
* carefully read through the error messages or output
* make sure that I'm thinking about what data types I'm working with so that I can choose the right methods / strategies
* write out what I'm doing on paper

I think I will re-do the section another time to make sure I really understand it and also to try out other strategies for solving the problems: different kinds of loops, array methods, heck... maybe even some recursive functions!


### Day 17: January 27, 2021 

**Today's Progress:** Finished a single lesson (#11) in section on basic algorithm scripting in freeCodeCamp's JavaScript certification.

**Thoughts:** It took me so long to solve this one, but I'm glad I took the time to really understand it. I know that if I just keep at it I'll start to gain some fluency with the different tools and strategies.


### Day 16: January 26, 2021 

**Today's Progress:** Finished to lesson #10 in basic algorithm scripting in freeCodeCamp's JavaScript ceritication.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with some of the problem sets today. A few things: 
 
* sometimes the problem is just that my internal panic monologue about not understanding drowns out my ability to calmly, rationally assess the problem. Maybe getting back to my meditation practice could help with this.
* I'm sticking a bit too much to the strategies I'm comfortable with (ie. for loops). For loops are fine and useful, but it would be good to develop a greated proficiency with other tools like .map() and .reduce();



### Day 15: January 25, 2021 

**Today's Progress:** Finished to lesson #7 in the section on basic algorithm scripting in freeCodeCamp's JavaScript certification, and all of the section on basic CSS in the Responsive Web Development certification.

**Thoughts:** Often my anxiety and frustration about not understanding JavaScript act as thought blockers. Like I'll be trying to work out a problem and feeling that I absolutely don't understand the basic logic, or what methods or loops to use, when in reality my anxiety has just gotten me so worked up that I'm just missing some fairly minor and obvious errors (things like switching up a variable name half way through, or forgetting to return the result!).

Feel good about deciding to start the Responsive Web Development certification as well. I'd been feeling frustrated to finally be understanding some JS, only to be stymied by getting my projects to work in the browser. Now I finally know about CSS variables! Working on CSS at the same time also provides a productive way for me to take breaks from learning JS when I get overwhelmed.


### Day 14: January 23, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Completed the section on basic data structures in freeCodeCamp JS certification. 

**Thoughts:** Got off track due to a week of intense fatigue and headaches. Happy to finally be able to get back to this! I hope to start on a new project tomorrow.


### Day 13: January 17, 2021

**Today's Progress:** I got the binary to decimal converter working in the browser! I tried to get the CSS working better but it's becoming clear that my CSS knowledge is severely lacking.

**Thoughts:** It felt so great to get the project working! I'd really like to get better at CSS.


### Day 12: January 15, 2021 

**Today's Progress:** Started working on making the binary to decimal converter work in the brower.

**Thoughts:** Not a terribly productive day. I quickly realized that I'd forgotten a lot about creating/adding/removing new elements with JS. Needing to re-watch a lot of videos to refresh my memory. Code is getting pretty long and messy and I don't feel that I have a good sense about how to re-factor things but I suppose this will improve with time and practice.


### Day 11: January 14, 2021 

**Today's Progress:** Did a few more lessons in the regex section (to lesson #31). Finally worked out the logic for the binary to decimal calculator!

**Thoughts:** I don't yet fully understand regex but I also like it. It seems very powerful. 

Figuring out the logic for the calculator felt so great... like I'd performed a magic trick! I used an html text input instead of number input in order to be able to loop through the digits and transform them with a Math.pow() using the index of the flipped number as the exponent. 


### Day 10: January 13, 2021 

**Today's Progress:** Completed up to lesson #28 in the regex section of freeCodeCamp's JS certification which came in very handy for my binary to decimal calculator (though I'm still not finished that). Did a bit of work on a meeting time decider app with Gabrielle. We are each working on our own respective JavaScript and Python versions.

**Thoughts:** So glad to finally know about regex! I've seen regex code from time to time in Stack Overflow posts and it's always been something that looked completely indecipherable so I'm glad that I'm finally learning what it is. Seems very useful!


### Day 9: January 12 

**Today's Progress:** Continued working on the binary to decimal calculator.

**Thoughts:** I got very frustrated and eventually (after exercising) realized that I was over-complicating it. I'll give it another try tomorrow and if I can't work it out I'll go back to doing projects that have solution videos that I can refer to when I get stuck.


### Day 8: January 11, 2021 

**Today's Progress:** Started working on a binary to decimal calculator (as suggested in Florin Pop's GitHub list of projects to build).

**Thoughts:** Didn't get as far as I would have liked because I had to spend a bit of time learning about binary (went back to CS50 course for this). Also got a bit sidetracked trying to do some basic CSS styling which was obviously not necessary but I like for things to look pretty. Realized I've forgotten so much CSS!


### Day 7: January 10, 2021 

**Today's Progress:** Completed to the end of section on ES6 in freeCodeCamp's JavaScript certification.

**Thoughts:** The first time I started learning about classes and Promises (in Colt Steele's course) I was rushing through the content, and as a result felt increasingly lost as I kept trying to plough through the lessons, so it was really good to review those topics today. Tomorrow I'm going to start working on a project. No excuses!!! 


### Day 6: January 9, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Worked through 1st Array Cardio Day of #JavaScript30. 

**Thoughts:** Was mostly able to write the code for the problem sets before watching the solutions (although Wes Bos' solutions were more elegant of course). I can see that array methods are gonna be really useful!


### Day 5: January 8, 2021 

**Today's Progress:** Finished up to lesson #19 in ES6 section of freeCodeCamp JavaScript certification. Mostly destructuring from objects and arrays.  

**Thoughts:** I'm feeling a bit bored. I know I need to work on small projects (not just problem sets on freeCodeCamp) in order to make things more interesting and keep myself motivated. I did follow along with the 3rd project in Wes Bos' #JavaScript30 series but didn't feel like I would have been able to code it myself, so definitely not counting that as part of my 1-hour of coding today. I think tomorrow I will try to code the project before watching the solution. I know it will give me a more solid understanding of how to make code do what I need it to do even if the code I come up with is a bit of a mess.


### Day 4: January 7, 2021 

**Today's Progress:** Completed JavaScript Basics section in freeCodeCamp course + up to lesson #4 in the section on ES6.

**Thoughts:** Still struggling to understand recursive functions but I think it's slowly starting to sink in.

 
### Day 3: January 6, 2021 

**Today's Progress:** Completed up to lesson #109 in freeCodeCamp's JS certification. Spent a good chunk of time on recursive functions. 

**Thoughts:** Realizing how often my code isn't working because I forget to *return* the result of a function! Also, the occasional comparison operator typo.


### Day 2: January 5, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Completed up to lesson #100 in freeCodeCamp's JS certification. Reviewed short-circuit conditionals. Started on recursive functions.

**Thoughts:** Short-circuit conditionals seem very useful, if not very intuitive. Ditto for recursive functions. Will need to make sure I take some time with both of these in order to really understand them.


### Day 1: January 4, 2021 

**Today's Progress:** Completed up to lesson #93 in freeCodeCamp's JS certification. Accessing and changing values in nested objects.  

**Thoughts:** I thought I already had a decent handle on those concepts but it turns out I didn't!... or maybe I had at one time and then forgot. Really reinforced the importance of using what I learn every day.


### Day 0: January 3, 2021 

**Today's Progress:** Completed up to lesson #80 in the Basic JavaScript section of freeCodeCamp's JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification.

**Thoughts:** I was feeling really tired today so it was good to just work on reviewing some of the foundational concepts. Why have I never tried freeCodeCamp before?? It's a great resource! Feeling excited / apprehensive about starting the #100DaysOfCode challenge. Hoping that the rules and public commitment will help me build better learning habits!
