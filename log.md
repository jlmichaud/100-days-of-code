### Day 1: January 4, 2020 

**Today's Progress:** Completed up to lesson #93 in freeCodeCamp's JS certification. Accessing and changing values in nested objects.  

**Thoughts:** I thought I already had a decent handle on those concepts but it turns out I didn't!... or maybe I had at one time and then forgot. Really reinforced the importance of using what I learn every day.


### Day 0: January 3, 2020 

**Today's Progress:** Completed up to lesson #80 in the Basic JavaScript section of freeCodeCamp's JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification.

**Thoughts:** I was feeling really tired today so it was good to just work on reviewing some of the foundational concepts. Why have I never tried freeCodeCamp before?? It's a great resource! Feeling excited / apprehensive about starting the #100DaysOfCode challenge. Hoping that the rules and public commitment will help me build better learning habits!
