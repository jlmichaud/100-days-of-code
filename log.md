# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 3, 2020 

**Today's Progress:** Completed up to lesson #80 in the Basic JavaScript section of freeCodeCamp's JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification.

**Thoughts:** I was feeling really tired today so it was good to just work on reviewing some of the foundational concepts. Why have I never tried freeCodeCamp before?? It's a great resource! Feeling excited / apprehensive about starting the #100DaysOfCode challenge. Hoping that the rules and public commitment will help me build better learning habits!
